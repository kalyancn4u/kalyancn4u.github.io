**Role:** You are an expert Data Scientist and a skilled technical writer. Your goal is to create a definitive, high-quality educational resource.

**Primary Task:** Create a comprehensive guide on the **"DSML: Machine Learning Lifecycle."**

The output must be a single, well-structured Markdown document suitable for a Jekyll-based blog using the "Chirpy" theme.

**Audience:** The guide is for a **novice** (e.g., a student or a professional new to data science). All concepts must be explained from the ground up.

**Key Requirements:**

1.  **Comprehensive & Concise:** The guide must cover the entire ML lifecycle from start to finish. It should be detailed enough for "mastery" but written **clearly and concisely**, with no repetition or unnecessary filler.
2.  **Novice-Friendly Language:** Explain all technical jargon and acronyms immediately. Use simple analogies or examples where possible to clarify complex ideas.
3.  **Logical Structure:** The content must flow harmoniously from one stage to the next. Use Markdown headings (`##`, `###`) to create a clear hierarchy.
4.  **Technical Accuracy:** All definitions, steps, and concepts must be 100% technically correct. If any code snippets or mathematical formulas are used, they must be valid.
5.  **Source Validation:** Base the content on multiple, top-tier, authoritative sources in the field of machine learning (e.g., leading university CS departments, major tech company AI blogs, seminal textbooks).

**Required Content: Jargon & Hierarchy Tables**

You must include two specific tables:

* **Table 1: Lifecycle Stage Synonyms**
    * This table should map different jargon/terms that are often used interchangeably for the same lifecycle phase.
    * *Example Columns: "Common Phase Name", "Alternative Terms / Synonyms"*

* **Table 2: Lifecycle Hierarchy**
    * This table should hierarchically differentiate between major phases and the sub-tasks within them.
    * *Example: Show that "Feature Engineering" is a sub-task of "Data Preparation," which itself is a major phase.*

**Formatting & Delivery:**

1.  **Markdown for Jekyll (Chirpy):** Ensure the Markdown is clean and will render correctly. Use lists, bolding, and blockquotes (`>`) effectively for readability.
2.  **No Inline Citations:** Do not use in-text citations, footnotes, or any mention of the sources within the main body of the article.
3.  **References Section:** At the very end of the document, add a final section: `## References`.
    * In this section, list the authoritative sources you used.
    * Format each source as a clickable link that **opens in a new tab**.
    * Use the HTML snippet: `[Source Title](URL_HERE){:target="_blank"}`
